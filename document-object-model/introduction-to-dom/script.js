/*
This Javascript File will focus on understanding the 
document object model. 

Four main nodes: 
1. Document 
2. Element 
3. Attribute 
4. Text 

These will be focused on as to how to access and use these nodes. 

The html document linked to this JS file has elements with IDs 
attached to them in order to be worked with to understand DOM

var firstItem = document.getElementById('one'); 
/*
The statement above is "catching" the first element 
from the list. 

Because the element will be worked on more than once 
it is assigned to that variable name. 

Remember, 

to use these methods the parent node DOCUMENT 
must first be called, and then dot notation is used to 
work with elemental nodes. 

The id Value of the first item from the list is passed 
in quotes inside the brackets.
