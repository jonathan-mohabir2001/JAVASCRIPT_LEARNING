/*
This JS file will focus the document object model for the first time. 

The dom is not JS or HTML, it is like a set of rules which 
dictates how HTML is modeled onto a page, and how JS can access and 
updates contents of that page. 

HTML model: ("DOM TREE")
4 main nodes of DOM tree: Document, Element, Attribute, Text 
JS manipulation: Own methods and properties to access and change objects from the tree.
