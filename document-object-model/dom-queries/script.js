Understanding the DOM, is to understand how to work with the DOM TREE.

// TO WORK WITH NODES AND THEIR ELEMENTS, DOM QUERIRES NEED TO BE MADE 

document.getElementById('one'); 
document.getElementById('two'); 
document.getElementById('three'); 
document.getElementById('four'); 

// THESE DOM QUERIES ONLY CATCH THESE IDs ONLY ONCE 

// DOM QUERIES WILL BE ASSIGNED TO VARIABLES TO WORK WITH THAT ELEMENT MORE THAN ONCE 

var mainPage = document.getElementById('page'); 

// this is the end of simple DOM Querires.
