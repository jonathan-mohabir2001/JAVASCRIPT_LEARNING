/*
Varibale practise for working with ES6 concepts 

Before 2015, the only way to make varibales within js 
was to use the var keyword. 
*/
// looking at const...this was introduced with ES6 
var pizza = true;
console.log(pizza)
pizza = false; 
console.log(pizza); 
// these statements are interchangable with their values because the var keyword is used. 
const random = true; 
//random = false
//the above statement causes an error as the constant value cannot be changed.
