# JAVASCRIPT_LEARNING
This repository will contain my fundamental knowledge of Javascript for reference. 

All base knowledge is taken from 'JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY - interactive front end web development' written by Jon Duckett. 

Knowledge is then applied into real life code as you can see within this repository. Sections are broken down into their own directories to show what I have learned 
as I progress.
