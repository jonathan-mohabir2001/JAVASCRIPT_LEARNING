# JAVASCRIPT_LEARNING
This repository will contain my fundamental knowledge of Javascript for reference. 


Everything in relation to my Javascript lanaguage has been taken from a textbook written by the other James Duckett, full credit to him for producing 
this wonderful textbook. 

Javascript is the languge I have made a priority to learn for the summer months of April - September 2022.
